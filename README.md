VPN Lab: Testing VPN Behavior with Azure VM and ProtonVPN

Overview

This lab demonstrates how VPN usage can alter public IP addresses and influence regional web content. A Windows 10 virtual machine was deployed in Azure, connected to ProtonVPN, and tested for geolocation-based changes in web browsing.

1. Initial IP Address Logging

Started by recording the public IP address of the local machine:

- Navigated to [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)
- Saved the displayed IP for reference later in the lab

2. Azure Virtual Machine Deployment

Provisioned a Windows 10 virtual machine in Azure, selecting a geographic region outside of the local area:

- Created a new **Resource Group**
- Deployed the VM in a different country
- Connected via Remote Desktop (RDP)

Once inside the VM:

- Visited [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to capture the VMâ€™s public IP
- Logged this second IP address to compare against later VPN testing

3. ProtonVPN Installation and VPN Testing

Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account using the official website:

- [https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free](https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free)

Within the Azure VM:

- Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client
- Logged in to [https://account.protonvpn.com/login](https://account.protonvpn.com/login)
- Connected to a VPN server based in **Japan**

After establishing the VPN connection:

- Returned to [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to note the third, VPN-assigned IP address

To observe how location affects web content, several sites were tested:

- [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)
- [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com)
- [https://www.disney.com](https://www.disney.com)

Regional differences were noted in areas such as language, localized product offerings, and automatic domain redirection.

4. Resource Cleanup

Deleted the previously created Azure Resource Group to deallocate and remove all associated cloud resources.

- Confirmed successful deletion of the VM and network components
3. VPN Installation and Testing

On Local Machine:

- Sign up for a free ProtonVPN account:  
  [https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free](https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free)

Inside the Azure VM:

- Download and install the ProtonVPN client
- Log in to ProtonVPN:  
  [https://account.protonvpn.com/login](https://account.protonvpn.com/login)
- Connect to a VPN server in a third location (e.g., Japan)
- Visit: [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)
- Record the **VPN-masked IP address** in your text file

Test Browsing Experience:

- Navigate to sites like:
  - [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)
  - [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com)
  - [https://www.disney.com](https://www.disney.com)
- Observe:
  - Any changes in **language**, **URL redirection**, or **localized content** based on the VPN location
